Well met, Champion of Valhalla.
I have cast thee down back to Midgard to stop the coming of Ragnarok, the prophesized apocalypse. 
To do this, thou must slay the Trickster God, Loki.
Know that I shalt be watching…
(end)
T’would seem that Loki has uncovered my plans.
But I see thou hath already made short work of the Jotun he sent to stop thee.
As expected from the greatest hero of Valhalla.
